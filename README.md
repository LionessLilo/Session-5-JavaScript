# JavaScript Homework

## Brief
Create a function that takes a name input from the user and displays it in a “Hello” alert statement.

## What I learnt
I struggled with how to pass the input into the function and the variable.value was a gamechanger for me in understanding how to put the pieces together. As I understood better I ended up removing a lot of unnecessary code.
